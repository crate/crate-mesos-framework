Crate Mesos Framework
=====================

This is an integration framework which allows running and managing the Crate_
database through Mesos_.

.. warning::

    The Crate Mesos Framework is intended to be used for quickly launching
    Crate on a Mesos cluster for testing purposes.
    It's not recommended for production use yet and changes in the API might
    break older installations!
